<br><p>Sri Lanka - ADB is supporting Sri Lanka’s bid to increase the use of solar power and other renewable energy sources in providing electricity to the whole country and meet its commitment to the Paris Agreement on climate change. The government’s Battle for Solar Energy program envisions 1000 megawatts of solar power generation capacity by 2025—all from the rooftops of homes and businesses.

    In 2017, ADB approved a $50 million loan for Sri Lanka’s Rooftop Solar Power Generation Project, which would finance the development of rooftop solar photovoltaic systems and support the government’s target to increase the share of nonconventional renewable energy generation in Sri Lanka’s power generation mix. The project provided the credit line that would enable businesses and households to finance the installation of solar PV generation facilities atop their houses and building.
    
    The Ministry of Finance is managing the credit line, in close collaboration with the Ministry of Power, and Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority. Funds are channeled to the beneficiaries through selected participating financial institutions</p></body>
